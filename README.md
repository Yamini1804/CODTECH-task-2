TOPIC:INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION
The interactive quiz application is a dynamic web-based tool that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean blue-themed design and responsive layout. The application displays questions one at a time, with options users can click directly to submit their answers. Feedback is provided immediately—correct answers turn green, while incorrect ones turn red—along with a smooth transition to the next question. The quiz automatically progresses without requiring a "Next" button, and the user’s score is calculated based on their correct answers. At the end of the quiz, the result is displayed with a summary of the total score, offering a seamless and engaging user experience.
